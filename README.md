# ft_ls

0	-	Time display seems to screw up sometimes. Specific instace
		is when ./ft_ls is run, it's time seems to have the first
		digit of the minutes, while the rest is the same as the
		size.

0	-	free and clear unsused memory

0	-	padding for group name

0	-	fix blockcount. Seems it must count the files that ARE NOT hidden, unless -a is specified
